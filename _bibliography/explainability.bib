abstract={Automatic speech recognition systems based on end-to-end models (E2E-ASRs) can achieve comparable performance to conventional ASR systems while reproducing all their essential parts automatically, from speech units to the language model. However, they hide the underlying perceptual processes modelled, if any, and they have lower adaptability to multiple application contexts, and, furthermore, they require powerful hardware and an extensive amount of training data. Model-explainability techniques can explore the internal dynamics of these ASR systems and possibly understand and explain the processes conducting to their decisions and outputs. Understanding these processes can help enhance ASR performance and reduce the required training data and hardware significantly. In this paper, we probe the internal dynamics of three E2E-ASRs pre-trained for English by building an acoustic-syllable boundary detector for Italian and Spanish based on the E2E-ASRs' internal encoding layer outputs. We demonstrate that the shallower E2E-ASR layers spontaneously form a rhythmic component correlated with prominent syllables, central in human speech processing. This finding highlights a parallel between the analysed E2E-ASRs and human speech recognition. Our results contribute to the body of knowledge by providing a human-explainable insight into behaviours encoded in popular E2E-ASR systems.},
